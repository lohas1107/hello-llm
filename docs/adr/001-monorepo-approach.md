# ADR-001: Monorepo Approach

## Status
Proposed - Will try no tool approach first

## Context
- Need monorepo architecture for managing multiple products
- Backend uses Python and Go
- Frontend uses TypeScript
- Require flexibility to split/merge projects in the future
- Need to avoid tight coupling between services
- Want to keep tech stack simple and minimal

## Decision
Start with no monorepo tool approach (Make + Scripts) to keep tech stack lean, then evaluate if we need dedicated tooling

## Consequences

### Positive
- No additional abstraction layer to learn
- Full control over build processes
- Minimal tech stack complexity
- Easy to understand and maintain
- No vendor lock-in
- Can always add tooling later if needed

### Negative
- No intelligent caching
- Manual dependency tracking
- No affected commands
- Limited scalability for large teams
- More manual configuration required

### Neutral
- Need to create custom scripts for common operations
- Team responsible for maintaining build infrastructure

## Alternatives Considered

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **No Tool**<br>(Make + Scripts) | ‚Ä¢ No abstraction<br>‚Ä¢ Full control<br>‚Ä¢ No learning curve<br>‚Ä¢ Minimal tech stack | ‚Ä¢ No intelligent caching<br>‚Ä¢ Manual dependency tracking<br>‚Ä¢ No affected commands<br>‚Ä¢ Poor scalability | ‚úÖ **Selected**<br>Start simple, add complexity when needed |
| **Nx** | ‚Ä¢ Excellent TypeScript support<br>‚Ä¢ Plugin architecture for Python/Go<br>‚Ä¢ Smart caching & affected commands<br>‚Ä¢ Good developer experience<br>‚Ä¢ Dependency visualization | ‚Ä¢ Python/Go via community plugins<br>‚Ä¢ Additional abstraction layer<br>‚Ä¢ Learning curve for Nx concepts | üîÑ **Future consideration**<br>If simple approach becomes insufficient |
| **Bazel** | ‚Ä¢ True polyglot support<br>‚Ä¢ Hermetic builds<br>‚Ä¢ Google-scale proven<br>‚Ä¢ Fine-grained dependency tracking | ‚Ä¢ Very steep learning curve<br>‚Ä¢ Complex configuration<br>‚Ä¢ Overkill for our scale<br>‚Ä¢ Poor developer experience | ‚ùå Too complex |
| **Turborepo** | ‚Ä¢ Simple configuration<br>‚Ä¢ Fast builds<br>‚Ä¢ Good for JS/TS<br>‚Ä¢ Low learning curve | ‚Ä¢ Limited Python/Go support<br>‚Ä¢ JS-centric design<br>‚Ä¢ Less extensible than Nx | ‚ùå Insufficient polyglot support |

## Migration Path
If the simple approach becomes insufficient, we can migrate to Nx as the next step, given its good balance of features and complexity.
